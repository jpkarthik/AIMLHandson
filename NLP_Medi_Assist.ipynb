H+ may\\ncome from gastric HCl or from fatty acids released during digestion of fats—the latter sometimes\\nproduces several hundred mEq of H+. The acid products released by bacterial fermentation of\\nunabsorbed carbohydrates in the colon may also react with HCO3- to produce CO2. Although bloating\\nmay occasionally occur, the rapid diffusion of CO2 into the blood generally prevents distention.\\n[Table 8-5. Some Causes of Gas-Related Complaints]\\nDiet accounts for much of the variation in flatus production among individuals, but poorly understood\\nfactors (eg, differences in colonic flora and motility) may also play a role.\\nDespite the flammable nature of the H2 and CH4 in flatulence, working near open flames is not\\nhazardous. However, gas explosion, even with fatal outcome, has been reported during jejunal and\\ncolonic surgery and colonoscopy, when diathermy was used during procedures in patients with\\nincomplete bowel cleaning.\\nEvaluation\\nHistory: Patients with belching should have the history directed at finding the cause of aerophagia,\\nespecially dietary causes.\\nIn patients complaining of gas, bloating, or flatus, the relationship between symptoms and meals (both\\ntiming and type and amount of food), bowel movements, and exertion should be explored. Certain\\npatients, particularly in the acute setting, may use the term \"gas\" to describe their symptoms of coronary\\nischemia. Changes in frequency and color and consistency of stool are sought. History of weight loss is\\nnoted.\\nPhysical examination: The examination is generally normal, but in patients with bloating or flatus, signs\\nof an underlying organic disorder should be sought on abdominal, rectal, and (for women) pelvic\\nexamination.\\nRed flags: The following findings are of concern:\\n• Weight loss\\n• Blood in stool (occult or gross)\\nInterpretation of findings: Chronic, recurrent bloating or distention relieved by defecation and\\nassociated with change in frequency or consistency of stool but without red flag findings suggests irritable\\nbowel syndrome.\\nLong-standing symptoms in an otherwise well young person who has not lost weight are unlikely to be\\ncaused by serious physiologic disease, although an eating disorder should be considered, particularly in\\nyoung women. Bloating accompanied by diarrhea, weight loss, or both (or only after ingestion of certain\\nfoods) suggests a malabsorption syndrome.\\nTesting: Testing is not indicated for belching unless other symptoms suggest a particular disorder.\\nTesting for carbohydrate intolerance (eg, lactose, fructose) with breath tests should be considered\\nparticularly when the history suggests significant consumption of these sugars. Testing for small-bowel\\nbacterial overgrowth should also be considered, particularly in patients who also have diarrhea, weight\\nloss, or both, preferably by aerobic and anaerobic culture of small-bowel aspirates obtained during upper\\nGI endoscopy. Testing for bacterial overgrowth with H2 breath tests, generally glucose-H2 breath tests, is\\nprone to false-positive (ie, with rapid transit) and false-negative (ie, when there are no H2-producing\\nbacteria) results. New, persistent bloating in middle-aged or older women (or those with an abnormal\\npelvic examination) should prompt pelvic ultrasonography to rule out ovarian cancer.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 8.

Approach to the Critically Ill Patient\\nIntroduction\\nCritical care medicine specializes in caring for the most seriously ill patients. These patients are best\\ntreated in an ICU staffed by experienced personnel. Some hospitals maintain separate units for special\\npopulations (eg, cardiac, surgical, neurologic, pediatric, or neonatal patients). ICUs have a high\\nnurse:patient ratio to provide the necessary high intensity of service, including treatment and monitoring\\nof physiologic parameters.\\nSupportive care for the ICU patient includes provision of adequate nutrition (see p. 21) and prevention of\\ninfection, stress ulcers and gastritis (see p. 131), and pulmonary embolism (see p. 1920). Because 15 to\\n25% of patients admitted to ICUs die there, physicians should know how to minimize suffering and help\\ndying patients maintain dignity (see p. 3480).\\nPatient Monitoring and Testing\\nSome monitoring is manual (ie, by direct observation and physical examination) and intermittent, with the\\nfrequency depending on the patient's illness. This monitoring usually includes measurement of vital signs\\n(temperature, BP, pulse, and respiration rate), quantification of all fluid intake and output, and often daily\\nweight. BP may be recorded by an automated sphygmomanometer; a transcutaneous sensor for pulse\\noximetry is used as well.\\nOther monitoring is ongoing and continuous, provided by complex devices that require special training\\nand experience to operate. Most such devices generate an alarm if certain physiologic parameters are\\nexceeded. Every ICU should strictly follow protocols for investigating alarms.\\nBlood Tests\\nAlthough frequent blood draws can destroy veins, cause pain, and lead to anemia, ICU patients typically\\nhave routine daily blood tests to help detect problems early. Generally, patients need a daily set of\\nelectrolytes and a CBC. Patients with arrhythmias should also have Mg, phosphate, and Ca levels\\nmeasured. Patients receiving TPN need weekly liver enzymes and coagulation profiles. Other tests (eg,\\nblood culture for fever, CBC after a bleeding episode) are done as needed.\\nPoint-of-care testing uses miniaturized, highly automated devices to do certain blood tests at the patient's\\nbedside or unit (particularly ICU, emergency department, and operating room). Commonly available tests\",\n","  'metadata': {'Chunk_idx': 2, 'batch_id': 100},\n","  'similarity_score': 0.6966580152511597},\n"," {'content': \"hypovolemic patients with preexisting pulmonary hypertension.\\nPrognosis and Treatment\\nUntreated shock is usually fatal. Even with treatment, mortality from cardiogenic shock after MI and from\\nseptic shock is high (60 to 65%). Prognosis depends on the cause, preexisting or complicating illness,\\ntime between onset and diagnosis, and promptness and adequacy of therapy.\\nGeneral management: First aid involves keeping the patient warm. Hemorrhage is controlled, airway\\nand ventilation are checked, and respiratory assistance is given if necessary. Nothing is given by mouth,\\nand the patient's head is turned to one side to avoid aspiration if emesis occurs.\\nTreatment begins simultaneously with evaluation. Supplemental O2 by face mask is provided. If shock is\\nsevere or if ventilation is inadequate, airway intubation with mechanical ventilation is necessary. Two\\nlarge (16- to 18-gauge) IV catheters are inserted into separate peripheral veins. A central venous line or\\nan intraosseous needle, especially in children, provides an alternative when peripheral veins cannot\\npromptly be accessed (see also p. 2250).\\nTypically, 1 L (or 20 mL/kg in children) of 0.9% saline is infused over 15 min. In major hemorrhage,\\nRinger's lactate is commonly used. Unless clinical parameters return to normal, the infusion is repeated.\\nSmaller volumes (eg, 250 to 500 mL) are used for patients with signs of high right-sided pressure (eg,\\ndistention of neck veins) or acute MI. A fluid challenge should probably not be done in a patient with signs\\nof pulmonary edema. Further fluid therapy is based on the underlying condition and may require\\nmonitoring of CVP or PAOP.\\nPatients in shock are critically ill and should be admitted to an ICU. Monitoring includes ECG; systolic,\\ndiastolic, and mean BP, preferably by intra-arterial catheter; respiratory rate and depth; pulse oximetry;\\nurine flow by indwelling bladder catheter; body temperature; and clinical status, including sensorium (eg,\\nGlasgow Coma Scale—see\\nTable 174-4 on p. 1661), pulse volume, skin temperature, and color.

Septic shock develops in 25 to 40% of\\npatients with significant bacteremia.\\nDiagnosis\\nIf bacteremia, sepsis, or septic shock is suspected, cultures are obtained of blood and any other\\nappropriate specimens (see p. 1166).\\nTreatment\\n• Antibiotics\\nIn patients with suspected bacteremia, empiric antibiotics are given after appropriate cultures are\\nobtained. Early treatment of bacteremia with an appropriate antimicrobial regimen appears to improve\\nsurvival. Continuing therapy involves adjusting antibiotics according to the results of culture and\\nsusceptibility testing, surgically draining any abscesses, and usually removing any internal devices that\\nare the suspected source of bacteria.\\nBiological Warfare and Terrorism\\nBiological warfare is the use of microbiological agents for hostile purposes. Such use is contrary to\\ninternational law and has rarely taken place during formal warfare in modern history, despite the extensive\\npreparations and stockpiling of biological agents carried out during the 20th century by most major\\npowers. For a variety of reasons (including uncertain military efficacy and the threat of massive\\nretaliation), experts consider the use of biological agents in formal warfare unlikely. The area of most\\nconcern is the use of such agents by terrorist groups. Biological agents are thought by some people to be\\nan ideal weapon for terrorists. These agents may be delivered clandestinely, and they have delayed\\neffects, allowing the user to remain undetected.\\nPotential biological agents include anthrax, botulinum toxin, brucellosis, encephalitis, viruses,\\nhemorrhagic fever viruses (Ebola and Marburg), plague, tularemia, and smallpox. Each of these agents is\\npotentially fatal and, except for anthrax and botulinum toxin, can be passed from person to person.\\nAnthrax is of most concern; anthrax spores are relatively easy to prepare and spread through the air,\\ncreating the potential for distribution by airplane. Theoretically, 1 kg of anthrax could kill 10,000 people,\\nalthough technical difficulties with preparing the spores in a sufficiently fine powder would probably limit',\n","  'metadata': {'Chunk_idx': 38, 'batch_id': 53},\n","  'similarity_score': 0.9235097169876099}]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":70}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Query 2 What are the common symptoms for appendicitis, and can it be cured via medicine?

The obstruction leads to\\ndistention, bacterial overgrowth, ischemia, and inflammation. If untreated, necrosis, gangrene, and\\nperforation occur. If the perforation is contained by the omentum, an appendiceal abscess results.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe classic symptoms of acute appendicitis are epigastric or periumbilical pain followed by brief nausea,\\nvomiting, and anorexia; after a few hours, the pain shifts to the right lower quadrant. Pain increases with\\ncough and motion. Classic signs are right lower quadrant direct and rebound tenderness located at\\nMcBurney's point (junction of the middle and outer thirds of the line joining the umbilicus to the anterior\\nsuperior spine). Additional signs are pain felt in the right lower quadrant with palpation of the left lower\\nquadrant (Rovsing sign), an increase in pain from passive extension of the right hip joint that stretches\\nthe iliopsoas muscle (psoas sign), or pain caused by passive internal rotation of the flexed thigh\\n(obturator sign). Low-grade fever (rectal temperature 37.7 to 38.3° C [100 to 101° F]) is common.\\nUnfortunately, these classic findings appear in < 50% of patients. Many variations of symptoms and signs\\noccur. Pain may not be localized, particularly in infants and children. Tenderness may be diffuse or, in rare\\ninstances, absent. Bowel movements are usually less frequent or absent; if diarrhea is a sign, a\\nretrocecal appendix should be suspected. RBCs or WBCs may be present in the urine.
